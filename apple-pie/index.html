      <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one<br>
      quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place <br>
      prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in a saucepan.
    Stir in<br>  flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
    to a boil. Reduce<br>temperature and let simmer.</li>

       <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with<br> 
         a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so <br> 
        that it does not run off. </li>

        <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br>
           degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
